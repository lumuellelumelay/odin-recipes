In this project I will build a basic recipe website. I will demonstrate my knowledge on building basic website.

## HTML

This website will showcase my skills on HTML markup tags and my knowledge on HTML. The markup tags that I will demonstrating are:

1. Ordered list
2. Unordered list
3. Headings
4. Paragraphs
5. Links

## CSS

Now that I have a foundation on html, it is time for me to design my website.
